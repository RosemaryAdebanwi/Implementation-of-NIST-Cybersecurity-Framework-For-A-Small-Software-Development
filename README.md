# Implementation of NIST Cybersecurity Framework For A Small Software Development

<h2>Overview:</h2>
As a GRC analyst, I guided a fast-growing software startup through the implementation of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to strengthen its security posture. Conducting a cybersecurity maturity assessment, I identified key gaps and developed a tailored roadmap for implementing security controls. By aligning the startup’s expanding operations with industry best practices, I ensured a scalable, resilient approach to cybersecurity—protecting both the business and its clients. Additionally, I outlined how to create a presentation that highlights the implementation plan.
